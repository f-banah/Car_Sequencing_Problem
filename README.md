# Car_Sequencing_Problem
Car Sequencing Problem solving with Constraint Programming approach and Choco Solver.
In the car-sequencing problem, a number of cars must be arranged on a line respecting several constraints. This problem was solved by both Operations Research (OR) and Constraint Programming (CP) communities, either as a decision problem or as an optimization problem. 
This project introduces Car Sequencing Problem (CSP) and comes up with mathematical model to formulate as a constraint satisfaction problem , then develop the model result with the Java solver named "Choco Solver".
